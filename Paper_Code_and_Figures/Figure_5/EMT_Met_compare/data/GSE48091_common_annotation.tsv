GSM1167774	Primary tumor breast - BCPT0950	Public on Jul 08 2015	Jun 19 2013	May 27 2016	RNA	1	Primary tumor breast	Homo sapiens	1	validation	1002	Primary tumor breast	The fresh frozen tumor samples were collected from liquid nitrogen and cryosectioning was performed on a Cryo-Star HM 560 M. Five μm sections were cut from the surface of the same tumor sample that was used for isolation of RNA and DNA. The section was counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin and dehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol to xylene before mounting. The percentage of tumor cells, as well as the percentage of epithelial cancer cells in relation to stroma, was quantified in the frozen tumor sections by a breast cancer pathologist.	total RNA	Extraction of total RNA from frozen tumors was carried out using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The integrity of the RNA extracts was tested on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Rockville, MD), measuring the 28S: 18S ribosomal RNA ratio. RNA extracts of high quality were stored at -70C until microarray analyses.	biotin	Preparation of in vitro transcription (IVT) products and oligonucleotide array hybridization and scanning were performed according to the Affymetrix protocol (Santa Clara, CA, USA). In brief, the amount of starting total RNA for each probe preparation varied between 2 and 5 μg. IVT reactions were performed in batches to generate biotinylated cRNA targets, which were subsequently chemically fragmented at 95C for 35 min.	The arrays were scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Genechip® Technical Manual, 2001). The scanned images were inspected for the presence of obvious defects (artifacts or scratches) on the array. In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

Five μm sections were cut from the surface of the same tumor sample that was used for isolation of RNA and DNA.

The percentage of tumor cells, as well as the percentage of epithelial cancer cells in relation to stroma, was quantified in the frozen tumor sections by a breast cancer pathologist.	total RNA	Extraction of total RNA from frozen tumors was carried out using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The integrity of the RNA extracts was tested on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Rockville, MD), measuring the 28S: 18S ribosomal RNA ratio. RNA extracts of high quality were stored at -70C until microarray analyses.	biotin	Preparation of in vitro transcription (IVT) products and oligonucleotide array hybridization and scanning were performed according to the Affymetrix protocol (Santa Clara, CA, USA). In brief, the amount of starting total RNA for each probe preparation varied between 2 and 5 μg. IVT reactions were performed in batches to generate biotinylated cRNA targets, which were subsequently chemically fragmented at 95C for 35 min.	The arrays were scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Genechip® Technical Manual, 2001). The scanned images were inspected for the presence of obvious defects (artifacts or scratches) on the array. In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

The arrays were scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Genechip® Technical Manual, 2001). The scanned images were inspected for the presence of obvious defects (artifacts or scratches) on the array. In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

The arrays were scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Genechip® Technical Manual, 2001). The scanned images were inspected for the presence of obvious defects (artifacts or scratches) on the array. In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.

The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects.

The integrity of the RNA extracts was tested on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Rockville, MD), measuring the 28S: 18S ribosomal RNA ratio. RNA extracts of high quality were stored at -70C until microarray analyses.	biotin	Preparation of in vitro transcription (IVT) products and oligonucleotide array hybridization and scanning were performed according to the Affymetrix protocol (Santa Clara, CA, USA). In brief, the amount of starting total RNA for each probe preparation varied between 2 and 5 μg. IVT reactions were performed in batches to generate biotinylated cRNA targets, which were subsequently chemically fragmented at 95C for 35 min.	The arrays were scanned according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix Genechip® Technical Manual, 2001). The scanned images were inspected for the presence of obvious defects (artifacts or scratches) on the array. In case of visible microarray artifacts, the sample was rehybridized and rescanned on new chips using the same fragmented probe.	The microarray analysis was done in the open source software R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Each array was individually background corrected and normalized using robust multichip averaging (RMA). The arrays were then quantile normalized for comparability. Only perfect match (PM) probes were used in the normalization steps. The signals from multiple PM probes targeting the same transcript were summarized using a probe level model adjusting for chip effects. A variance filter was employed and probes with inter-quartile-range less than 0.5 were excluded, resulting in 28449 retained probes.
